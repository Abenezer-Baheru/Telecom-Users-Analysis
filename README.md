# Telecom Users Data Analysis

This repository contains scripts for analyzing telecom users' data. The analysis is divided into four tasks, each focusing on different aspects of the data.

## Table of Contents
- [Data Cleaning and Preprocessing](#task-1-data-cleaning-and-preprocessing)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](#task-2-exploratory-data-analysis-eda)
- [Aggregation and Clustering](#task-3-aggregation-and-clustering)
- [Satisfaction Score Analysis](#task-4-satisfaction-score-analysis)

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In this task, we clean and preprocess the telecom users' data to prepare it for analysis. The steps include:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Converting data types.
4. Removing duplicates.
5. Saving the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. The steps include:
1. Visualizing the distribution of key variables.
2. Analyzing correlations between variables.
3. Identifying patterns and trends.

## Aggregation and Clustering
In this task, we aggregate information per customer and perform clustering analysis. The steps include:
1. Calculating average RTT and throughput.
2. Aggregating information per customer.
3. Performing k-means clustering.
4. Visualizing the results.

## Satisfaction Score Analysis
In this task, we analyze the satisfaction scores of customers based on their engagement and experience scores. The steps include:
1. Calculating average throughput and TCP retransmission.
2. Performing k-means clustering for engagement and experience scores.
3. Calculating engagement and experience scores based on Euclidean distance.
4. Normalizing the scores.
5. Calculating the satisfaction score as the average of normalized engagement and experience scores.
6. Reporting the top 10 satisfied customers.
7. Performing linear regression to predict satisfaction scores.
8. Visualizing the predicted vs actual satisfaction scores.
9. Aggregating the average satisfaction and experience scores per cluster.
10. Visualizing the average satisfaction and experience scores per cluster.
